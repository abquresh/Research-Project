To make the plots for the project I have used the python scripts. Now for plotting we need the coordinates , 
so I generated the coordinates by using the Largest.java file by running the required functions that are present
in that file.

1.)To plot the fraction of infected nodes run this file:-
Name :- Plot of fraction of infected population.ipynb

2.) To make the plot of largest-component vs r run this file:-
Name :- Largest-component plot.ipynb

3.) To get the plot of all points plotted run this file:-
Name :- Plotting.ipynb

4.) To make the plot of largest-component vs r  with continuous legend run this file:-
Name:- Untitled.ipynb

5.) To make plot of all points plotted with edges visible run this file:-
Name:- view of plot.ipynb
